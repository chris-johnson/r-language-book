# `{base}`

`is.atomic()` if numeric, logical, character, complex, raw, or null <!-- written as null, not NULL; verify? -->
`is.language()` 
`is.recursive()` if list; returns FALSE if S4

`show()` for console; `View()` for IDE. (Neither `return()` a value.)

    random_sample <- 
      sample(
        x = letters,
        size = 10
      ) %>%
      show(
        object = .
      )
  
## `do.call()`

    do.call(
      what = function_name, 
      args = list(arg_1, arg_2, arg_3)
    )

is equivalent to

    function_name(arg_1, arg_2, arg_3)

## Quoting functions (`{base}`)

Unlike `{rlang}` analogs, quoting functions from `{base}` do not support unquoting. (This was the motivation for quasiquotation.)

* `quote()`
* `substitute()`
* `alist()`
* `bquote()`
* `~`

## Accessors

`::` is an accessor, and it used to access exported functions from a package.

`:::` is used to access non-exported functions. Non-exported functions may not be documented.
