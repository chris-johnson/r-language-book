# Operators

Some operators have functional forms. E.g.

* `<-` is the same as `assign()`
* `::` is the same as `getExportedValue()`

Operators also have a _prefix forms_. E.g.

* `x <- 3` is the same as ```<-`(x, 3)``
* `dplyr::mutate` is the same as ```::`(dplyr, mutate)``
* `mtcars$mpg` is the same as ```$`(mtcars, mpg)``
* `mtcars[["mpg"]] is the same as ```[[`(mtcars, "mpg")``

Note: ```$``` can take `mpg`, whereas ```[[``` requires `"mpg"`.

<!-- Extra credit

Why do both of the following work?

    `$`(mtcars, mpg)
    `$`(mtcars, "mpg")
