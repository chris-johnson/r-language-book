After `browser()` has been called, submitting 

* `c` or `cont` to exit the browser and continue execution
* `f` to finish execution of the current loop or function
* `s` to evaluate the next statement
* `where` to print a stack trace
* `r` to resume
* `Q` to quit

`help` can be submitted to see the above commands

If an object named `c`, `cont`, `f`, `s`, `where`, `r`, or `Q` exists, those must be wrapped with `get()`, e.g. `get("f")`.
